# 🕶️ [Portfolio Website](https://srcjosh.com/)
A generic portfolio website that loads my work from GitHub and displays it in a presentable way. Aims to also provide a bit of information about myself at the same time.

## 🚩 Site's Goals
- [x] A bit about me
- [x] Familiar programming languages
- [x] Social media links
  - [ ] Contact me options
- [x] GitHub projects
  - [x] Homepage link
  - [x] Dominated language, if not all
- [ ] Life timeline (in empty space to the right)

## ⚾ Running the React app
You can easily run this and modify it, so long as it complies with the GPL 3.0 license, by using `npm i && npm start`.
